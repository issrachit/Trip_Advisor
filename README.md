TripAdvisor is the most popular travel website and it stores data for almost all restaurants, showing locations (even latitude and longitude coordinates), restaurant descriptions, user ratings and reviews, and many more aspects.
The website is well known for displaying user ratings and reviews for restaurants, hotels, b&b, touristic attractions, and other places, with a total word count of all reviews is more than 10 billion.
I have taken datatset from https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/tripadvisor-european-restaurants.
